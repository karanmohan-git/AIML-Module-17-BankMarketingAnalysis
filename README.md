# Practical Application III: Bank Marketing Campaign Analysis

This project explores the "bank-additional-full.csv" dataset, focusing on comparing the performance of various classifiers to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit. The dataset originates from the UCI Machine Learning repository and contains results from marketing campaigns conducted by a Portuguese banking institution.

## Project Overview

This project aims to compare the performance of four different classifiers:

*   K Nearest Neighbor
*   Logistic Regression
*   Decision Trees
*   Support Vector Machines

The goal is to find the best performing model for predicting customer subscription to a term deposit based on various bank marketing campaign features.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

1.  **Data Understanding:** Thorough analysis of the dataset, including the study of input variables like age, job type, marital status, education level, credit default, loan status, contact type, campaign details, and socio-economic context attributes.
2.  **Feature Engineering:** Data cleaning, renaming columns, and categorical feature encoding.
3.  **Model Building:** Setting up pipelines, splitting data into training and testing sets, and building the following classification models.
    *   K-Nearest Neighbors
    *   Logistic Regression
    *   Support Vector Machines
    *   Decision Trees
4.  **Model Evaluation and Comparison:** Evaluating the model performance with metrics such as accuracy, and examining the confusion matrices.
5.  **Further Improvements:** Hyperparameter tuning and grid search to improve model performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is "bank-additional-full.csv" from the UCI Machine Learning repository. It contains details about a Portuguese banking institution's marketing campaigns and is a collection of multiple results of multiple marketing campaigns.

## Project Results

*   Performance of each model has been assessed and can be seen with the confusion matrix and the classification report.
*   Recommendations for the best performing model given the results.
*   Insights for improvements that can be applied to the model.

## Acknowledgments

*   Thanks to the UCI Machine Learning Repository for providing the dataset.
